# Suggestion-and-Complaint
 A web-based system for managing student complaints and suggestions. The platform allows students to submit issues with full details and optional attachments, while supervisors can respond, manage the request status (Open/Closed), and trigger email replies. The system also supports admin-level control, account activation, and user authentication.
